This folder contains coding projects that I have previously worked on.

AutonManager is code that I wrote as part of a club.  The git repository is private git repository that I cannot share.  This file is my portion of the code that was used to control a robot for the VEX competition.  My code was in charge of calling the FeedBack Controllers in a way that made scripting easier for the autonomous portion of the competition.

Ackermann's Function is my first experience with recursive functions.  I found the code online and learned how to use recursion from searching online and testing with the function.

Autocar_final.ino is the code for my semester project in my highschool digital electronics class.  The project was originally intended to be autonomous but my teacher told me about a project he was working on that used Adafruit.io to control LEDs.  I then changed my project to modifying my RC car to be controlled over wifi.  The final product could either connect to wifi network so that it can be controlled by Adafruit.io or it would create a wifi network that could be connected to by any wifi capable device to control the car from there.

FizzBuzz contains an assortment of random coding challenges I have tried.  Many of these are from YouTube videos talking about coding challenges from programming interviews that I tried because I was interested in new coding ideas.

InfiniteMonkeys is an example of a recursive function that I have written.  It is based off the phrase "If there were infinite monkeys at infinite typewriters, they would eventually type all the works of Shakespear."  I wanted to do this in a more controlled fashion so I wrote a recursive function to print out every possible string of alphabetical characters and spaces at every length.
