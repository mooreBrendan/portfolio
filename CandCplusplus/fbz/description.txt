This is my implementation of the 'fizz-buzz' coding interview challenge.  For my program, I focused on making it as easy to customize as
possible.  The program is called and the first 2 arguments are the start and end indexes.  After that, the arguments are taken in sets of
two, where the first is the multiple that is to be checked and the second is the statement that should be printed if true.  This program
uses a sorted linked list to store the test statements so that if the program is given enough memmory, it can test against infinite
testcases.
