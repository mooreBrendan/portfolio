This program simulates how ants are able to maintain balance of current tasks.  The ants keep track of the pheremones that correspond to
each task and count how many of each they pass by.  If they notice a smaller ammount of some workers, they will switch to performing that
task.  This allows the ants to keep a balance of workers so that even if a large amount of ants are taken out, without the ants having to
know the total number of ants performing each task.  This program simulates this by having dots of different types/colors moving arround
randomly.  The dots keep track of the ants that pass with in their perception radius and will change type if the number is outside of
tolerance.  This program has functions to change all ants of one type to another or to remove ants in a given area.  This will allow the
program to demonstrate the balancing ability of the ants population.
